MVVC architecture:

Models(can also be classified as View-Controllers): "store" suffix files and the JSON db, deal with the json data, reading and writing to these raw json files. These modules abstract over the raw json data

    book_store.py; check_store.py; user_store.py;

View: "main.py" file and "menus.py" file provide top level abstraction for the CLI.
    main.py; menus.py;

View-Controller: "manager" suffix files, deal with the Models, receive data/instructions from View and make several necessary ammends; include limited CLI.
    book_manager.py; check_manager.py; user_manager.py;

supplementary modules:
    custom_validators.py: implemented custom validation check functions on different kinds of inputs.
    log.py: for logging into raw json db.
    models.py: python oop blueprints for objects from raw json files
